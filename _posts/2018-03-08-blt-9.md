title: BLT 9.0.0 Released!
---

BLT 9.0.0 has been released! It introduces many new features and improvements. Be sure to read the [release notes](https://github.com/acquia/blt/releases/tag/9.0.0) for a comprehensive list of changes and for __upgrade instructions__.

### Summary of changes

* BLT commands
  * Based on a [good deal of conversation](https://github.com/acquia/blt/issues/2452) and [public survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevUditb23M6NGIwfy-fQcXnguhuqiFBeWMIZ_858rJGkjtAg/viewanalytics), we've reorganized BLT's command names to be more consistent and comprehensible. Backwards compatibility has been preserved, you can still use the old command names if you'd prefer.
  * After creating a new project, or simply running the new `blt wizard` command, BLT will provide you with a series of prompts to help configure your new project. You can also provide your answers to the prompts non-interactively by passing a recipe yml file: `blt wizard --recipe=my-recipe.yml`.
* Requirements
  * BLT 9 requires a minimum version of PHP 7.1.
  * BLT 9 requires Drush 9.
* Drupal VM
  * All BLT commands must now be run inside the VM. BLT will no longer proxy `blt` commands into the VM using Drush aliases or `vagrant ssh`.
  * BLT now supports generating a DrupalVM instance using either the default `geerlingguy/ubuntu1604` base box or the somewhat newer and faster `beet/box`. 
  * BLT now provisions Drupal VM with PHP 7.1 and Node 9 by default.
* Pipelines
  * BLT now configures Pipelines to use PHP 7.1 by default, and also works with CDEs out of the box. Files and databases are automatically synced to CDEs upon creation. 
* Multisite & Site Factory (ACSF)
  * You may now define site-specific BLT configuration in a `docroot/sites/[site]/blt.yml` file. 
  * You may also define site-specific drush configuration in `docroot/sites/[site]/drush.yml`, and local-only per-site drush configuration in `docroot/sites/[site]/local.drush.yml`. 
  * You may now define site-specific Drupal configuration via a [multisite configuration split](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/9.x/readme/config-split/#multisite-split). Site specific config should be stored in `config/sites/[site]`.
  * All default ACSF hooks have been updated in accordance with new best practices. 
  * A new `blt recipes:multisite:init` will create a new `docroot/sites/[site]` dir containing all suggested config files. It will also create a new drush alias in `drush/sites/[site].site.yml` and a new config directory for per-site config at `config/sites/[site]`.
* Misc
  * BLT now includes [default memcache configuration for Acquia Cloud](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/9.x/settings/memcache.settings.php). 
  * BLT now supports environment-specific config. `blt [command] --environment=[env-name]` will cause BLT to load config  from `blt/[env-name].blt.yml`. Alternatively, you may define BLT_ENV variable in your shell.
