title: BLT 8.9.11 released
---

[BLT 8.9.11](https://github.com/acquia/blt/releases/tag/8.9.11) has been released.

This release most importantly forces new versions of upstream dependencies in order to avoid critical bugs with those dependencies. See especially #2251.

It also removes support for Drush 9 in the 8.9.x branch, since Drush 9 is still unstable and was causing problems with various other products.
