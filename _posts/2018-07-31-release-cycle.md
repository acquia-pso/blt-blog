title: Adopting a new release cadence.

In an effort to better support users and more frequently release improvements, the BLT maintenance team has decided to adopt a twice monthly release cadence for patch or minor version releases to the currently active major version (i.e., BLT 9.x at present). 

On or about the 1st and 15th of the month, we'll release a new patch version containing all the changes tested and merged since the prior patch release. In recent months, there has been a good bit of action on the codebase but if the pace slows and there is nothing to release in a given cycle, we'll skip that release.

Major versions in LTS status will be updated on an as-warranted basis.
