title: BLT 9.1.4.
---

BLT 9.1.4 is now live. Wondering what happened to 9.1.3? Yeah...

So, we had a little problem with 9.1.2 when deploying to ACSF sites and quickly cut an out-of-cycle 9.1.3 release to get it fixed. But in the hubhub we forgot to announce it here. Sorry, y'all. Our bad.

We're happy to announce that with this release we're back on schedule and bringing you a whole host of goodies, some of which have been a long time in the making. As always, you can [view the full changelog on Github](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/9.1.3...9.1.4), but some of the things we're excited about in this release are:

* We've added the [Drupal Spec Tool](https://github.com/acquia/drupal-spec-tool) to the list of tools we bundle. If you're not familiar with this tool already, it's well worth the time to check it out.
* We've added the PHPUnit bridge component to make running core tests easier.
* Now, when deploying a tag manually using `blt deploy`, you'll have the option to have your source repo tagged as well. This should make it much easier to correlate changes in the source repo to changes in your artifact repo.

We're also making some exciting process changes, which you'll see reflected in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md and the template when you open pull requests. These are part of our goal to make the review process faster and more reliable. No more PR's languishing in the queue for months!

Happy BLT'ing!
