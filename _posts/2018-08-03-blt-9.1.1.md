As Robert Burns observed, "the best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse)). So, this cycle, went our plans to cut the 9.1.1 release on August 1.

Nonetheless, the BLT team is pleased to announce the release of BLT 9.1.1. You can [view the full changelog on Github](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/9.1.0...9.1.1), but notable changes in this release include:

* Support for newer PHPUnit versions
* Adding support for generation of ACSF site aliases.
* Testing the project against PHP 7.2

Happy BLT'ing!
