title: BLT 8.9.10 released
---

[BLT 8.9.10](https://github.com/acquia/blt/releases/tag/8.9.10) has been released.

This primarily provides a workaround for an upstream change to Drupal 8.4 that was causing Composer to download unstable versions of Drupal core (typically 8.4.0-alpha1). It also fixes bugs related to the db sync setup method.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/8.9.9...8.9.10)

- #1976: Deploy --tag parameter causes frontend builds to fail

**Enhancements**
