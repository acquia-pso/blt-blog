title: Announcing BLT 9.1.5 and 9.2.0-alpha1.
---

Today the BLT team has released two updates, BLT 9.1.5 and BLT 9.2.0-alpha1.

BLT 9.1.5 addresses issues reported in 9.1.4 stemming from two events outside our control: an update to the Drupal Memcache module and the release of Drupal core 8.6.0. [See the changelog on Github](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/9.1.4...9.1.5) for details, but the short version is that BLT 9.1.x is now pinned to the 8.5.x series of Drupal core.

To move to the new hotness of Drupal 8.6.0 you want to look to the BLT 9.2.x branch. We've updated that to track all the updates to Drupal core and Lightning. At present, it's in an alpha status as we make sure everything works. Assuming things look good, we'll move to beta, rc, and hopefully a full 9.2.0 release in the next couple weeks.

Going forward, new features will be added to the 9.2 branch but the 9.1 series will continue to recieve bug fixes until such time as Drupal core 8.5 is no longer supported by the community.

Happy BLT'ing!
