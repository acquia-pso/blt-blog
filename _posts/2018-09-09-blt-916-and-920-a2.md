title: Announcing BLT 9.1.6 and 9.2.0-alpha2.
---

The BLT team has released two updates, BLT 9.1.6 and BLT 9.2.0-alpha2.

For 9.1.6, the memcache issues we thought we'd fixed in 9.1.5 weren't as fixed as we thought. [See the changelog on Github](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/9.1.5...9.1.6) for details.

For [9.2.0-alpha2](https://github.com/acquia/blt/compare/9.2.0-alpha1...9.2.0-alpha2), we squashed the memcache bug discussed above, cleaned up some documentation about git hooks, and fixed it so PHPUnit can bootstrap from core.

Happy BLT'ing!
